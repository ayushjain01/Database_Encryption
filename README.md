# Databse Encryption Using Servlet and JDBC
This system provides a user-friendly registration form in the frontend, developed using Java Servlet
and JDBC. The registration form collects various data points from the student, including their usn,
name, address, and phone number.
After the student enters their data, the system encrypts the data before storing it in the database. In
this scenario, a substitution cipher is used to encrypt the data collected from the student registration
form before storing it in the database. A substitution cipher is a type of encryption technique where
each letter in the plaintext is replaced by another letter or symbol based on a predetermined
substitution key.
Overall, the system provides a secure and efficient way to collect and store sensitive student data,
while also providing a user-friendly registration process for students. The use of Java Servlet and
JDBC helps to ensure the security and reliability of the system.
